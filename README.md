# Dimensionality-Reduction-Using-PCA

In this project, PCA was applied to the Digit Recognizer dataset from Kaggle to reduce its dimensionality. Initially, KNN was tested on the high-dimensional dataset to establish a performance baseline. The KNN algorithm was retrained on the PCA-transformed data, resulting in comparable accuracy with reduced computational complexity. Additionally, 2D and 3D interactive plots were created using Plotly to visualize the distribution of digit classes in the principal component space.
